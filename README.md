Case study Exploring Customer Engagement and Purchasing Patterns in an E-commerce using SAS Enterprise Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset/data

Objective: The dataset simulates a comprehensive e-commerce environment, covering various aspects of customer behaviour and purchase history within an E-commerce Industry. The primary objectives of the case study is include exploring customer shopping habits, predicting customer churn, and identifying purchase patterns.

The project utilizes three main tools: SAS e-Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep. These tools play distinct roles in the analysis:
SAS e-Miner:
Objective: SAS e-Miner is employed for predictive modeling and data analysis in the e-commerce domain. It likely facilitates tasks such as customer churn prediction, where historical data is used to develop models that can predict whether a customer is likely to stop using the platform based on their behavior.

Talend Data Integration:
Objective: Talend Data Integration is involved in the data processing and integration tasks. It is used to clean, transform, and integrate the synthetic dataset, ensuring that the data is prepared for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, standardizing formats, and combining data from different sources.

Talend Data Prep:
Objective: Talend Data Prep is utilized for data preparation tasks specific to the e-commerce dataset. This tool is likely used for exploratory data analysis, understanding the structure of the dataset, and preparing it for further analysis. It may involve tasks such as feature engineering, identifying trends, and addressing any data quality issues.

Overall, the project focuses on analyzing a synthetic e-commerce dataset using SAS e-Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep. Its goals include understanding customer behavior, predicting churn, and identifying purchase patterns. By combining these tools, the project aims to take a comprehensive approach to e-commerce data analysis and modeling.
